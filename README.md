# ig-whosFollowing

## Description

- This is a simple script that leverages Puppeteer to scrapes instagram and informs you of two petty things.
    - who is not following you back
    - who you aren't following back

## SETUP

1. First clone the repo. Move into the main directory and run.

```
npm i
```

2. After that create a .env file with the information below
- be sure to replace the italicized words with your actual authentication information.

```
IG_ID=*YOUR LOGIN ID*
IG_PASSWORD=*YOUR PASSWORD*
```

3. Finally run 

```
npm run start
```

4. Now you wait for your results.

## Many Improvements Required

Currently the wait time is generally hard coded to a certain time. This can be improved on to wait for more follower/following list items to show up.
